  |   Homo Machina is a puzzle game inspired by the work of avant-garde     |
  |   scientist Fritz Kahn. Set off on a crazy journey to solve the         |
  |   surreal puzzles of Homo Machina and learn about the internal          |
  |   working of the human body, represented as a gigantic 1920s factory.   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In this narrative puzzle, players are plunged into an ingenious       |
  |   system of nerves, vessels and valves. The aim is to help the body     |
  |   function correctly in about thirty steps or so throughout the         |
  |   entire day. Each scene breaks down daily acts, such as opening your   |
  |   eyes, chewing a toast or listening to music, through seamless         |
  |   navigation and intuitive and inventive gameplay.                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Fritz Kahn, a pioneer of infographics and popular science, came up    |
  |   with easy to understand analogies to enable people to improve their   |
  |   understanding of the human body. By combining old school design       |
  |   with a contemporary influence, Homo Machina delights with its         |
  |   clever dialogue between the absent-minded director at the helm of     |
  |   the body-machine and Josiane, his diligent secretary, encouraging     |
  |   players to put to task the armada of workers to get the incredible    |
  |   factory up and running.                                               |
  |                                                                         |
